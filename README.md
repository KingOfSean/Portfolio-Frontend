# Portfolio/ Capstone Project

## Introduction
I have created a personal portfolio as my capstone project at General Assembly.
I chose this as my capstone because I realised that employers will see my portfolio first before any of my other projects, and if my other projects didn't WOW them, I could attempt to do so with my porfolio while also showing
off most of the skills I learned at the same time.

## Technologies
I used quite a few technologies to create this app.
- MERN Stack (Backend API)
- React
- MongoDB
- Postgres SQL
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Heroku
- React Styled Components
- React Icons
- Postman

## Resources
1. External API

## Unsolved Problems
- On reload in the details page, app crashes
- on reload on pages outside of home page, home link is gone
    until another link is clicked.

## Future Enhancements
- fix bugs
- add another carousel on about me page as well as details pages.
